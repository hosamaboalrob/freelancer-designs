During my freelance work with remote shops, my primary responsibility was to design and develop layouts using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. Each project included a "show page" file, showcasing the design on a web page for clients to review and provide feedback. Additionally, I maintained consistent communication with clients throughout the design process to ensure their needs and preferences were met effectively.
